Support:
Just a support tab where u can support me by buying me a coffee because uhmm scripts aren't cheap to make (time wise) and I hate Bytenet so yeah  getting past that was a significant headache.

Notes:
While I pride myself with my code; the ESP/Waypoints may cause fps drops (sorry), voidness isn't fully supported with a few features (especially auto stuff); base game isn't also fully supported (sorry I coded this horribly and I'm trying to optomise it after I get all the features done). Last but not least, give me some feedback and suggestions! Either on this thread; or on my github!

 

uhmm and then script (I use Volt so yuh; not sure if many xecutors can support the script since I obfuscated it with Luraph):
